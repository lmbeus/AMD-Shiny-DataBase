# AMD-Shiny-DataBase

I am an avid PC enthusiast and builder, so knowing all the information about various CPU's (Central Processing Unit) availabe on the market is something that is important for me. Rather than having to do a bunch of research across the internet it would be easier to have all the information I need in one place to compare and contrast the various offerings. This projects consists of two data sets: an official AMD data set of their CPU offerings and various information(variables) about each CPU, and a dataset from PC Part Picker that also showcases AMD CPU offerings and various information about each one. Both data sets contain unique information about each AMD CPU, so the goal of this project is to clean the two data sets and format them properly to be merged into a dataset that contains information from both AMD and PC Part Picker about AMD's Ryzen and Threadripper CPU offerings. These are the newer consumer desktop processors that led to AMD's rise in the last few years, so naturally these are the CPU's that are most relevant to the average consumer. The Ryzen processors are the most popular, with the threadripper being ultra-high end CPU's generally used for more intensive tasks than your average PC, even the high end ones. The final table will be created into a searchable Datatable using the shiny package in R.
